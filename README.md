# AYU Laravel interview repo

This is a simple example project to manage appointments for companies.

It was not built by AYU, it's forked from https://github.com/LaravelDaily/Laravel-Appointments

We're going to use it to play around with adding features to an existing codebase. The only reason we've chosen this one is that it's a little repo that's easy to set up.

## Before your interview

Before your interview, clone the repo and get it set up so we can write some code.

-   Clone the repository with **git clone**
-   Run **composer install**
-   Run **php artisan key:generate**
-   Run **php artisan migrate --seed** (it has some seeded data for your testing)
-   Run **php artisan serve**
-   Your app should now be running at http://127.0.0.1:8000 (or some other port if you've got other sites running)
-   You can login to adminpanel with default credentials __admin@admin.com__ - **password**

That's it, you're ready for your interview. You may want to poke around the app a little bit to understand the structure before we start, but this little app wasn't built by AYU, and we aren't going to use it beyond the interview, so don't spend any more time than absolutely necessary!

## During your interview

-   5~10 minutes: We're going to discuss a change that we'd like to make to this app
-   30~35 minutes: We'll implement that change in the quickest, simplest way we can
-   20 miutes: We'll discuss other ways to implement this change, and long-term considerations of the different options
